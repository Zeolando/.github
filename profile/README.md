# Zeolando Project

## Welcome to our GitHub Repository

The **Zeolando** project aims at understanding how zeolites behave under *operando* conditions, i.e. real-world conditions used during catalytic processes, by combining reactive neural network potentials with *operando* spectroscopy.

This GitHub repository serves as a hub for our research tools, workflows and data.
